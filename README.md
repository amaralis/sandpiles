# Sandpiles
Interactive cellular automata model.

### The Abelian sandpile model is a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality.

**Rules: every cell can hold 3 "sand grains". If it has more, they fall down onto the adjacent cells, left, right, top, and bottom.**

By dumping a large amount of "sand" onto a cell, and coloring the cells acording to the number of sand grains they hold, we can see how this behavior creates beautiful, fractal-like patterns.
Once the algorithm has run its course and the cells are all stable, not toppling over their contents onto their neighbors, that state is called the "identity element" for that particular system.
