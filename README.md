# Sandpiles
Interactive cellular automata model.

###The Abelian sandpile model is a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality.

**Rules: every cell can hold 3 "sand grains". If it has more, they fall down onto the adjacent cells, left, right, top, and bottom.**

By dumping a large amount of "sand" onto a cell, and coloring the cells acording to the number of sand grains they hold, we can see how this behavior creates beautiful, fractal-like patterns.
